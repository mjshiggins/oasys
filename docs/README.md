# open assistance systems
The purpose of oasys is to increase safety in motorcycle transportation through open-source ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems). Typically, ADAS features come in the form of automated braking to avoid collisions, lane keeping, and adaptive cruise control systems for cars and trucks. Typically, the most advanced safety features you'll find for motorcycles are things like ABS. oasys plans to change that.

## Project 1 - Heads-Up Spatial Awareness and Collision Warning
Lane splitting in Bay Area traffic can be pretty dangerous. Using cheap sensors and hardware, let's build a system to give riders the ability to know what's around them without taking their eyes off of the road ahead. Trajectory estimation would be cool, based on the lean angle of the bike and handlebar position. Will likely use solid state LIDAR or some other vision based processing/odometry.
